### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

4. **Run Migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

7. **Access the Login Page:**

    Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/`

## 🖼️ Frontend Overview

- The `login.html` template contains the login form.
- CSS styling is found in `Account/static/css/style.css`.
- The form is protected against CSRF attacks using Django’s built-in middleware.

## 🔒 Backend Overview

- User authentication is handled using Django’s built-in authentication system.
- Views in `Account/views.py` manage login and logout logic.
- URLs are configured in `project_name/urls.py` and `Account/urls.py`.

## 💡 Customization

- Modify `login.html` for your branding and input fields.
- Update `style.css` for a unique look and feel.
- Add additional fields or authentication methods as required.

## 🛡️ Security Tips

- Always use Django’s CSRF protection.
- Never store plain-text passwords; Django handles password hashing by default.
- For production, configure HTTPS and use environment variables for secrets.
